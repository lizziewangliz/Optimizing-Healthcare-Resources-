# Private Healthcare System: Operational & Clinical Analytics

## Project Overview

This project analyzes operational data from a private healthcare system to uncover key trends in patient demographics, visit behavior, disease prevalence, medication patterns, and specialty utilization. The analysis supports hospital management in making data-driven decisions to improve efficiency, patient care, and resource allocation.

## Objectives

- Identify demographic patterns and regional growth in patient volume
- Evaluate disease burden and prescribing trends by specialty and age group
- Highlight inefficiencies in lab testing turnaround and specialty scheduling
- Recommend strategic actions to address growing demand and chronic care needs

## Key Insights

- **Patient Growth**: Patient volume rose sharply from 2023 to 2024, with Texas leading in total patients and Michigan showing the highest female patient proportion.
- **Visit & Lab Trends**: Female visit volume increased notably. Lab tests outpaced patient growth by 3–4x, especially in pulmonology (25-day turnaround).
- **Disease Burden**: Depression and chronic airway obstruction are the top conditions, especially in middle-aged and elderly patients.
- **Medication Use**:
  - Internal Medicine frequently prescribes Alprazolam (anxiety) and Aspirin (heart health).
  - Pediatrics heavily relies on Amoxicillin (antibiotic), indicating seasonal infectious needs.
- **Specialty Utilization**: Primary care accounts for the majority of visits. Aging patients show stronger retention in specialty care.

## Strategic Recommendations

1. **Expand Women’s Health Services** to meet rising female demand.
2. **Scale Lab Testing Facilities** to reduce wait times and match test volume.
3. **Improve Chronic Disease Management** programs focused on mental health and pulmonary care.
4. **Optimize Specialty Scheduling** to address consultation delays and seasonal spikes.
5. **Adjust Medication Stocking** by state and specialty trends.

## Tools Used

- **Tableau** for dashboard development and visual analytics
- **Excel** for initial data prep 
- **Summary report** for strategic documentation
